# Mechatronics Project

The Mechatronics project at INSPER involves the creation of an **automatic pipetting machine** designed for laboratory use, aiming to optimize and increase the precision of the pipetting process. The team responsible for the project addressed the areas of **Mechanics**, **Electronics**, and **Software** to develop a functional prototype that meets the established requirements.

### üî© Mechanical Aspect

In the mechanical part of the project, detailed calculations were carried out for sizing essential components such as the **ball screw and bearings**, **linear guide**, and **carriage**. These calculations were fundamental to ensure the correct selection and integration of mechanical components, aiming for the machine's efficiency and durability.

### ‚ö° Electronic System

On the electronics side, the project included various components such as:

* A **core board** with the **STM32F103RB microcontroller**, responsible for sending signals and powering components
* **Debouncing** for stabilizing mechanical switches
* A **step-down converter** for voltage regulation
* Actuation systems for the **pipette** and the **X, Y, and Z axis motors**

These electronic components were integrated to ensure proper operation and control of the machine.

### üíª Software Development (C++)

The software was developed in **C++**, based on detailed **flowcharts** outlining the machine‚Äôs operations and functionalities. The programming followed these flowcharts to automate and enhance the accuracy of the tasks performed by the pipetting machine. The choice of C++ allowed for efficient control over hardware and real-time system performance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Product Development Process

The prototype development followed the conventional **Product Development Process (PDP)**, which included mechanical sizing and part fabrication, electro-electronic design, software programming, and the implementation of a **human-machine interface (HMI)**.
